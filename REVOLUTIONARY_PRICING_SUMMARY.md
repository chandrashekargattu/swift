# Revolutionary Predictive Pricing System 🚀

## Overview

I've implemented a groundbreaking predictive pricing system that revolutionizes cab booking by always offering the best prices to customers while maintaining business sustainability.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Real-Time Competitor Price Monitoring**
- Tracks prices from Uber, Ola, and Lyft in real-time
- Automatically adjusts our prices to be 10-15% cheaper
- Caches competitor data for performance

### 2. **Advanced ML-Based Demand Prediction**
- Uses RandomForest and GradientBoosting models
- Considers multiple factors:
  - Time of day/week patterns
  - Weather conditions
  - Traffic levels
  - Special events
  - Driver availability
  - Historical booking data

### 3. **Customer-Centric Price Optimization**
- **Surge Cap**: Maximum 2x (competitors go up to 4x)
- **Loyalty Discounts**: Up to 15% for regular customers
- **First Ride Bonus**: 20% off automatically
- **Price Lock**: Prices valid for 5 minutes after quote
- **Transparency**: Full breakdown of pricing components

### 4. **Revolutionary Pricing Algorithm**
```python
Final Price = Base Fare + Distance Fare + Time Fare
            × min(Demand Multiplier, 2.0)  # Capped surge
            × Weather Adjustment
            - Loyalty Discount
            - Promotional Discount
            
Always ensures: Our Price < Competitor Average × 0.85
```
