        hospitals = await self.find_nearest_hospitals(location)

        # 6. Start real-time monitoring
        await self.start_health_monitoring(booking_id)
```

### Frontend - Emergency UI

    navigator.vibrate([1000, 500, 1000]); // SOS pattern
    
    // Get vitals if available
    const vitals = await getSmartWatchData();
    
    // Trigger emergency protocol
    await api.triggerMedicalEmergency({
      location: currentLocation,
      vitals,
      symptoms: quickSymptomSelection
    });
  };
  
  return (
