### Changes Made

1. **Voice Assistant Button**
   - Position: `bottom-24 right-6` (moved up from bottom-6)
   - Size: `w-14 h-14` (slightly smaller than before)
   - Added pulse animation for visibility
   - Purple gradient: `from-purple-500 to-pink-500`
   - Tooltip on hover: "Voice Booking"

2. **AI Assistant Button** (unchanged)
   - Position: `bottom-6 right-6` 
   - Purple-pink gradient: `from-purple-600 to-pink-600`
   - Brain icon with activity indicator
   - Tooltip: "Advanced AI Assistant"

### Visual Hierarchy
- Voice button is positioned 72px above the AI button
- Both have hover tooltips for clarity
- Different icons (🎤 vs 🧠) for easy identification
- Slightly different color gradients
- Voice button has a subtle pulse animation

### User Experience
- No more overlapping buttons
- Clear visual distinction
- Easy access to both features

## Result
Users can now easily access both the AI chat assistant and voice booking features without any visual conflicts!
