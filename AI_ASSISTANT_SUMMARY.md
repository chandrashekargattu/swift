# AI Assistant Implementation Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Dependencies Added to requirements.txt
- Added `oauthlib==3.2.2` for social media OAuth integration
- Added `huggingface-hub==0.27.0` for HuggingFace model support
- All other AI/ML dependencies were already present:
  - langchain, langchain-community, langchain-openai, langchain-anthropic
  - numpy, pandas, scikit-learn
  - spacy, nltk, transformers, sentence-transformers
  - chromadb, faiss-cpu
  - openai, anthropic, google-generativeai

### 2. Public Chat Endpoint Created
- Added `/api/v1/chatbot/chat/public` endpoint for unauthenticated users
- Fixed missing imports (logger, datetime) in the API file
- Changed from non-existent `process_message` to `generate_response` method

### 3. Frontend Updated
- Modified `AdvancedChatbot.tsx` to use public endpoint when user is not authenticated
- Conditional logic to select endpoint based on authentication status

### 4. Installation Scripts Created
- `install_dependencies.sh` - Automated installation script
- `verify_ai_dependencies.py` - Verification script to check installations
- `AI_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup documentation

## Current Status

The AI assistant is now fully functional in lightweight mode. It provides:
- Intent classification
- Entity recognition (locations, dates, times, etc.)
- Sentiment analysis
- Context-aware responses
- Session management
- Support for both authenticated and public users

## Next Steps to Enable Full AI Features

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ./install_dependencies.sh
   ```

2. **Configure API Keys** in `.env`:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-key
   ```

3. **Restart Backend**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

## Testing the AI Assistant

### Via API:
```bash
# Public endpoint (no auth required)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chatbot/chat/public \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "I need to book a cab from Delhi to Mumbai"}'
```

### Via UI:
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Click the chat icon in the bottom right
3. Start chatting - it works for both logged-in and guest users

## Features Available

### Lightweight Mode (Current):
- Basic intent recognition
